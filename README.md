# Petrinets

A Programm to Create, Edit and Analyse Petrinets.

This is a university project from the wintersemester 2020/2021.
The timing of the first programming internship is didactically chosen so that no software engineering has yet been taught, at this time. 
Accordingly, the structure of the code needs to be improved.

It uses Graph Stream : https://graphstream-project.org for the visualisation. It is included in the dependency folder. 

The language of the program is german. There is no english localization yet.
